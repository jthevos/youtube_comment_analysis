I’m having a difficulty with the “ while loop” . I  have been following all your instructions to the T and still don’t know where I got it wrong . Regarding the guessing game It keeps asking for more guesses after failing the guess. The part where it’s supposed to write “sorry you failed “ never appears on the console. Just keeps offering more guesses . Please I’d really need your help. Thanks a lot for everything,2022-06-26T16:02:54Z,2022-06-26T16:02:54Z,0
