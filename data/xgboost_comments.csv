GrJP9FLV3FE |XGBoost in Python from Start to Finish| 2020-08-01T18:13:06Z |Hi Josh, for the numerical variable do you still code missing data as 0? if so, this 0 could be misleading to a real zero, right?| 2022-06-02T19:23:08Z 2022-06-02T19:23:08Z 0
GrJP9FLV3FE |XGBoost in Python from Start to Finish| 2020-08-01T18:13:06Z |Thank you for this great tutorial Josh! Your videos have immensely helped in understanding some of the complex topics. One thing I noticed while watching this tutorial is the handling of categorical features. I think the explanation you gave for "Why not to use LabelEncoding?" is applicable for models like Linear Regression, SVM, NN but not for Trees because they only focus on the order of the feature values. For example, in a set of [1,2,3,4], threshold < 1.5 would be equivalent to threshold == 1. Please let me know if my thought process in wrong.| 2022-05-27T20:47:30Z 2022-05-27T20:47:30Z 0

GrJP9FLV3FE |XGBoost in Python from Start to Finish| 2020-08-01T18:13:06Z |Thank you for this XGBoost tutorial video. It makes people like me so easy to follow. In this tutorial, you printed gain, cover, total_gain and total_cover at https://youtu.be/GrJP9FLV3FE?t=3231.

GrJP9FLV3FE |XGBoost in Python from Start to Finish| 2020-08-01T18:13:06Z |Quick note: At 43:30 instead of using the plot_confusion_matrix() which is now depreciated, you need to use ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(). This can be done as follows:
Include: from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay at the start with the other imports. Then when printing the confusion matrix you need to use the line: ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(clf_xgb, X_test, y_test, display_labels=["Did not leave", "Left"])| 2022-05-17T14:40:56Z 2022-05-17T14:40:56Z 1

GrJP9FLV3FE |XGBoost in Python from Start to Finish| 2020-08-01T18:13:06Z |I have a question about handling the pd.get_dummies(). When it is used for gender, it turns out the ( M or F) to  a  single column of 1 and 0. But if get_dummies is used for a column that has 3 or more unique values, it creates columns equal to number of unique values. Isn't it better to use argument drop_first=True to reduce the redundancy. If not, when do you recommend to use this argument?  BTW, thanks a lot for these great videos!

OtD8wVaFm6E |XGBoost Part 1 (of 4): Regression| 2019-12-16T14:00:04Z |Corrections:
16:50 I say "66", but I meant to say "62.48". However, either way, the conclusion is the same.
22:03 In the original XGBoost documents they use the epsilon symbol to refer to the learning rate, but in the actual implementation, this is controlled via the "eta" parameter. So, I guess to be consistent with the original documentation, I made the same mistake! :)

ap2SS0-XPcE |XGBoost Model in Python || Tutorial || Machine Learning| 2021-05-17T15:43:40Z |Thank you for the great content. 
I'm wondering why don't you use early_stopping_rounds during grid search? That way you could set num_trees to a fixed big number (like you did later when building the final model) and don't have to grid search over it. Also, using your approach you probably overfit during grid search (due to the high number of estimators) and only get the best parameters when using all of the 1000, 2000 or 3000 trees. 
In the final model, due to the fact that you use early_stopping_rounds, a different number of estimators will be used and therefore the optimal hyperparamters from the grid search are probably not the optimal hyperparameters for the final model. What do you think about it?| 2021-08-25T15:37:56Z 2021-08-25T15:37:56Z 1

gPciUPwWJQQ |Xgboost Classification Indepth Maths Intuition- Machine Learning Algorithms🔥🔥🔥🔥| 2020-10-12T16:01:17Z |Hi, thank you very much for this explanation! Great video! But I have one question. In 19:39 you first wrote 0 which is the probability of first row then you added learning rate*similarity weight. My question is instead of 0 shouldn't we write 0.5 which is the average probability of first (base model). 0.5+learning rate*similarity. Please correct me if I am wrong.| 2022-04-19T10:45:52Z 2022-04-19T10:45:52Z 1
gPciUPwWJQQ |Xgboost Classification Indepth Maths Intuition- Machine Learning Algorithms🔥🔥🔥🔥| 2020-10-12T16:01:17Z |Hi @krish 
First of all kudos to you Great video
Can you tell me how xgboost is different from Aprori alogrithm or does it cover every combination as in Aprori cover ( ie it's covers all the combination while creating tree as Aprori will cover for same problem statement)

Thanks and love your work

when you compute the output value you are catching the similarity weighted. I think it is incorrect for classification, isn't it? 
To compute the output you shouldn't square the residuals.

The model is clearly performing very well on the test data. What you can do is perform k-fold cross validation to be more sure that it gives high accuracy on various test sets .... But having high train and test accuracies is not overfitting, it means that the data is relatively simple for the model to learn.| 2022-05-20T07:09:13Z 2022-05-20T07:09:13Z 0

0ikyjpaUDFQ |Intro to XGBoost Models (decision-tree-based ensemble ML algorithms)| 2021-08-26T15:30:00Z |I think that in trying to make this video more accessible to beginners, it ended up being worse for most people. 

Someone that is only beginning won't know a lot of terms you used here and won't learn all these concepts with such short explanations and little visuals. And someone who is more advanced won't learn much because you don't go in depth into the concepts, code or functionality.

I don't think you needed to explain in this video concepts such as cross validation. But some visuals on how XGBoost splits the data, trains different trees, how and what is carried to the next tree, all that would have made this richer.

I know I would find it very interesting if you showed how to code those features like early stopping, tree pruning and incremental training. Are these done automatically? Is there a way to configure any of it? I would have loved to see a showcase of incremental training, seems awesome.

Lastly, this video felt like an add, like I was being sold this lib. Instead of just showing that it got a perfect accuracy on an small artificial dataset, why not compare it to other models. It's not that impressive if there are 10 other models that can also achieve this. And how does it compare in terms of training speed or in more complex real world data? It felt like this is a perfect model with no downsides and I should take your word for it that it can do all these great things and it will always get the best results| 2021-08-29T22:56:58Z 2021-08-29T22:56:58Z 2

8b1JEDvenQU |XGBoost Part 2 (of 4): Classification| 2020-01-13T12:30:01Z |Corrections:
14:24 I meant to say "larger" instead of "lower.
18:48  In the original XGBoost documents they use the epsilon symbol to refer to the learning rate, but in the actual implementation, this is controlled via the "eta" parameter. So, I guess to be consistent with the original documentation, I made the same mistake! :)

You said that we can put the initial probability to a value different than 0.5 if, for example, the training dataset is unbalanced. That means that xgboost can deal with unbalanced datasets without the needing to balanced the training dataset before submitting it to the model?| 2022-06-23T11:47:40Z 2022-06-23T11:47:40Z 0

One thing i still don‘t get is how does xgboost predict multiple classes (e.g. „most likely drug to use“ with drugs 1,2 and 3)?
Does this work like in multinomial logistic regression, where each class is checked against a baseline-class? Or is it something like a random forrest when using xgboost?| 2022-02-25T16:28:25Z 2022-02-25T16:28:25Z 0

_e0NFIaHY2c |Tune xgboost more efficiently with racing methods| 2021-07-29T23:53:09Z |Hi Julia. Great tutorial! I think it's a great time-saving solution for tuning random grid points. It would be awesome if tune_race_anova could work with tune_bayes, in that once random grids are selected from tune_race_anova, it could pass as "initial" into tune_bayes to fine-tune the best. But currently it does not work, as tune_race_anova only finishes one point that fits all folders and tune_bayes needs as least the same number as tuning parameters. Is there an way around? Again, great work! : )| 2021-09-01T05:40:16Z 2021-09-01T05:40:16Z 0

_e0NFIaHY2c |Tune xgboost more efficiently with racing methods| 2021-07-29T23:53:09Z |Cheers Julia, Great video! Have been wondering about xgboost a bit lately -in regards to using tidymodels vs using the underlying xgboost package directly, with xgb.train(). I've heard mention that xgb.train() has an "automatic stop", that limits the number of trees when no more improvement is detected. This seems pretty helpful (and a great processing-time saver) rather then having to pre-specify the number of trees used. But I'm certainly not a pro at xgboost, so was just wondering your opinion. I like that tidymodels can be applied to all models but was just wondering if, in doing so, this comes at a cost (for xgboost tuning, specifically)| 2021-07-30T03:53:11Z 2021-07-30T03:53:11Z 0

I am doing a machine learning model using the RandomForest and XGBoost algorithms. My data is a survey of samples derived from a large population. My data has a sampling weight which is the number of individuals in the population each respondent in the sample is representing. How can I apply this sampling weight in my ML model? The data also contains strata and clusters. Do I have to keep the sampling weight, strata, and cluster variables with my features?| 2022-04-03T22:28:29Z 2022-04-03T22:28:29Z 0

Thank you Dr. Rai for your great explanation. I have one question, though: When you divide the data into train and test data, you are using   data[ind==1, ] and data[ind==2, ]; it is not clear to me how this magically works; however, what I see is data[x, y], where  the only values that y can take  are blank, and integers from 1 to 400, and the only values y can take are blank, and integer values from 1 to 4. Can you explain to me what is going on? Or, is there any thing that I am missing?| 2021-02-11T19:35:25Z 2021-02-11T19:35:25Z 1
