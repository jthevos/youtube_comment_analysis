GrJP9FLV3FE,XGBoost in Python from Start to Finish,2020-08-01T18:13:06Z,Thank you for this great tutorial Josh! Your videos have immensely helped in understanding some of the complex topics. One thing I noticed while watching this tutorial is the handling of categorical features. I think the explanation you gave for Why not to use LabelEncoding? is applicable for models like Linear Regression SVM NN but not for Trees because they only focus on the order of the feature values. For example in a set of [1234] threshold < 1.5 would be equivalent to threshold == 1. Please let me know if my thought process in wrong.,2022-05-27T20:47:30Z,2022-05-27T20:47:30Z,0

GrJP9FLV3FE,XGBoost in Python from Start to Finish,2020-08-01T18:13:06Z,Quick note: At 43:30 instead of using the plot_confusion_matrix() which is now depreciated you need to use ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(). This can be done as follows:Include: from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay at the start with the other imports. Then when printing the confusion matrix you need to use the line: ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(clf_xgb X_test y_test display_labels=[Did not leave Left]),2022-05-17T14:40:56Z,2022-05-17T14:40:56Z,1

GrJP9FLV3FE,XGBoost in Python from Start to Finish,2020-08-01T18:13:06Z,I have a question about handling the pd.get_dummies(). When it is used for gender it turns out the ( M or F) to  a  single column of 1 and 0. But if get_dummies is used for a column that has 3 or more unique values it creates columns equal to number of unique values. Isn't it better to use argument drop_first=True to reduce the redundancy. If not when do you recommend to use this argument?  BTW thanks a lot for these great videos! I have learned a lot.,2022-04-20T05:35:28Z,2022-04-20T05:35:28Z,0

ap2SS0-XPcE,|XGBoost Model in Python || Tutorial || Machine Learning|,2021-05-17T15:43:40Z,Thank you for the great content. I'm wondering why don't you use early_stopping_rounds during grid search? That way you could set num_trees to a fixed big number (like you did later when building the final model) and don't have to grid search over it. Also using your approach you probably overfit during grid search (due to the high number of estimators) and only get the best parameters when using all of the 1000 2000 or 3000 trees. In the final model due to the fact that you use early_stopping_rounds a different number of estimators will be used and therefore the optimal hyperparamters from the grid search are probably not the optimal hyperparameters for the final model. What do you think about it?,2021-08-25T15:37:56Z,2021-08-25T15:37:56Z,1

OtD8wVaFm6E,XGBoost Part 1 (of 4): Regression,2019-12-16T14:00:04Z,Corrections:16:50 I say 66 but I meant to say 62.48. However either way the conclusion is the same.22:03 In the original XGBoost documents they use the epsilon symbol to refer to the learning rate but in the actual implementation this is controlled via the eta parameter. So I guess to be consistent with the original documentation I made the same mistake! :)Support StatQuest by buying The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning!!!PDF - https://statquest.gumroad.com/l/wvtmcPaperback - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZCKR4H6Kindle eBook - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZG79HXC,2020-01-14T11:45:39Z,2022-05-11T19:01:07Z,28

AvWfL1Us3Kg,XGBOOST in Python (Hyper parameter tuning),2019-12-31T11:55:04Z,Such an informative video about the tunning of xgboost hyperparameter. My question is can we extract mathematical equation for the input and output parameters. For instance I have successfully applied Xgboost regression to predict y parameter using X1 X2 X3 X4 input parameters now how can I get the xgboost's predicting equation between those input and output parameters.

In 19:39 you first wrote 0 which is the probability of first row then you added learning rate*similarity weight. My question is instead of 0 shouldn't we write 0.5 which is the average probability of first (base model). 0.5+learning rate*similarity.

4rikgkt4IcU,Using XGBoost for Time Series Forecasting in Python ❌ XGBoost for Stock Price Prediction Tutorial,2020-10-27T14:00:01Z,Nice! I have a time series problem where the data is at daily level for 3 years and we forecast for daily level 2 years out. Currently I use Prophet which works well. Prophet takes care of spike events (holidays) and weekly / yearly seasonality. Can I use XGBoost to do this? Your example here is forecasting one step out which will be like forecasting one day out for my case.,2022-03-25T17:52:22Z,2022-03-25T17:52:22Z,0

wGdtA09Aq_0,Class 22 Machine learning Boosting theory + Python (AdaBoost GBM and XGBoost),2021-04-13T14:40:19Z,So in AdaBoost each iteration looks at what misclassifications occurred and weights them higher so that in the next iteration we classify them correctly. Does this often lead to overfitting? Because theoretically wouldn't the model end up near perfect for the training data? Or do we similarly set hyperparameters like in DT's that create a stopping point?,2021-04-14T03:50:28Z,2021-04-14T03:50:28Z,0

0ikyjpaUDFQ,Intro to XGBoost Models (decision-tree-based ensemble ML algorithms),2021-08-26T15:30:00Z,I think that in trying to make this video more accessible to beginners it ended up being worse for most people. Someone that is only beginning won't know a lot of terms you used here and won't learn all these concepts with such short explanations and little visuals. And someone who is more advanced won't learn much because you don't go in depth into the concepts code or functionality.I don't think you needed to explain in this video concepts such as cross validation. But some visuals on how XGBoost splits the data trains different trees how and what is carried to the next tree all that would have made this richer.I know I would find it very interesting if you showed how to code those features like early stopping tree pruning and incremental training. Are these done automatically? Is there a way to configure any of it? I would have loved to see a showcase of incremental training seems awesome.Lastly this video felt like an add like I was being sold this lib. Instead of just showing that it got a perfect accuracy on an small artificial dataset why not compare it to other models. It's not that impressive if there are 10 other models that can also achieve this. And how does it compare in terms of training speed or in more complex real world data? It felt like this is a perfect model with no downsides and I should take your word for it that it can do all these great things and it will always get the best results,2021-08-29T22:56:58Z,2021-08-29T22:56:58Z,2
